### Day 11: January 31, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finally, I managed to complete the Survey form project. This one was very tricky for me.

**Thoughts**: The more CSS looks easier, the more deceiving it is. I was dumbfounded many times by even little components of CSS. Although I had completed the project, I must say I have learn more and more tricks of CSS. Inheritance would be the key concept which have to be learned.
