# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 21, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today, it was not much coding, but a lot of learning. I did prototyping the ideas I had in mind, with the help of an edX course.

**Thoughts**: I have planned to take this journey by building many projects alongside learning at freecodecamp.

### Day 2: January 22, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Like the previous day, today also not much coding. Just completed some challenges at freecodecamp. But learned more about UI/UX and overall designing.

**Thoughts**: I have to find a way to code more and sticking to project(s). Hope I can do so in forthcoming days.
