# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 21, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today, it was not much coding, but a lot of learning. I did prototyping the ideas I had in mind, with the help of an edX course.

**Thoughts** I have planned to take this journey by building many projects alongside learning at freecodecamp.
